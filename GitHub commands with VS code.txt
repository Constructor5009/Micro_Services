---------------Github commands-----------------

step 1) open the folder in you vs code that you want to upload.

step 2) use terminal to run these commands.

git init       -> can be used only once to make the folder a git folder.

git add .	-> to upload the updated version

git commit -m "First commit"  -> commit with some msg like First commmit

// copy the path from github repository https link

git remote add origin https://github.com/Constructor5009/TestRepo.git 
-- this is to establish a connection between local repository and git repository
-- In origin we can provide any name to it.But the preference should be origin.

git push origin master

-- this is to push every single changes to the git repository.

now you can check the github repository the changes will be reflected there.

we have to check the master not main root


ex-
git remote add origin https://github.com/Constructor5009/test2.git
